# Refactor Your Two Resource App to use Directives
Refactor your two resource CRUD app to use Angular directives with testing. 

Create a minimum of three distinct directives: a list directive, a list item directive, and a form directive. 

At least one of these directives should call a function that has been passed with an `'&'`. 

Follow best practices with testing, by writing a separate test file for each of the directives.
